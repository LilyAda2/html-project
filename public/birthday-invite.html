<p><b>Hey you! YOU! Get ready to throw down at the most epic, unforgettable, slightly dramatic(but totally worth it) birthday bash of the century.</p>
<p>But hold up- this isn't your average, cake-and-leave kind of party. To get in, you've got to bring in some funky flair.</b></p>
<h3>Here's what's on the checklist:</h3>
<ul><b>
    <li>A questionable dance move</b><em>(No judgement, just vibes.Seriously, the weirder, the better.)</em></li>
    <b><li>Your loudest outfit</b><em>(glitter, feathers, or whatever screams "I'm the main character.")</em></li>
    <b><li>An awkwardly wrapped gift</b><em>(Weird shapes are a bonus!)</em></li>
    <b><li>Your Karaoke Spirit</b><em>(Because you will be singing, even if it sounds like a dying cat.)</em></li>
    <b><li>An Appetite</b><em>(there will be lots and lots of food!</em>)</li>
</ul>
