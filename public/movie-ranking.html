<h1>Top SRK's Movies According To Lily Ada.</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Veer-Zaara</h3>
<p>One of the top movies of SRK on my list. It's an eternal love story. Two lovers from different parts of the world, who stood the test of Time.</p>
<h3>My Name is Khan</h3>
<p>I could put this as number 1 on my list but that is by the way. A movie that has a social message for all of us to learn from. One lesson to take away from this movie is, they are only two types of people in the world; A good person or bad person. Don't jurge people by their caste, culture, religion orf colour. </p>
<h3>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</h3>
<p>A hopeless Romantic love story of two young adults who fought all obstacles to be together.</p>
<h3>Devdas</h3>
<p>A Drunk man who is hopelessly in love with his childhood friend but can never with her due to disputes and fuel amongst their families.</p>
<h3>Don</h3>
<p>One best thing I like about this movie is the songs in Don part 1. But I do love the Don villianous character played by Mr. Shahrukh Khan. He easily became the character and i loved him so in the part two. He was pure bad-ass villian trying to be good but very cunning at the same time. Also great action-packed movie.</p>
